# **Task 3: Training Considerations**


### 1. **Freezing the Entire Network**
#### Implications:
- **No Learning Happens**: If the entire network is frozen, none of the weights are updated during training. The model will only use the pre-trained weights for inference, meaning it cannot adapt to the specific tasks at hand.
- **Potential Use Case**: This approach would be beneficial if the pre-trained model already possesses enough knowledge to perform effectively on both tasks, and you believe that additional training won’t offer any further improvements (e.g., when the task is very similar to the original pre-training objective).

#### Rationale:
- This method is generally **not advised** if your tasks differ greatly from the original tasks the model was trained on. Freezing the entire network can be effective when the pre-trained model already possesses task-specific knowledge, such as when fine-tuning a language model trained on a corpus closely related to your target domain (e.g., legal texts or medical literature).

### 2. **Freezing the Transformer Backbone**
#### Implications:
- **No Updates to Transformer**: Freezing the backbone means that the transformer encoder will retain its pre-trained weights, and only the task-specific heads will be trained. The sentence embeddings generated by the transformer will not change, but the task-specific heads will learn to adapt these embeddings to your tasks.

#### Advantages:
- **Preserves General Knowledge**: The transformer has been pre-trained on a large corpus and captures general sentence representations. Freezing it allows you to leverage this general knowledge while saving time and computational resources.
- **Faster Training**: Freezing the transformer reduces the number of parameters being trained, which speeds up training.
- **Good for Small Datasets**: If you don’t have a large dataset for fine-tuning, freezing the transformer helps prevent overfitting to your specific data, while still allowing the task-specific heads to learn from your labeled data.

#### Rationale:
- **Recommended when using a small labeled dataset**. The pre-trained transformer can generate meaningful embeddings even if it’s frozen. Fine-tuning only the task-specific heads allows the model to adapt the general embeddings to each specific task (sentence classification, sentiment analysis, etc.) without changing the underlying sentence representations.
- **Transfer Learning Scenario**: This is a common approach in transfer learning, where the transformer is trained on a large, general corpus (e.g., books, Wikipedia), and you fine-tune the output layers for specific downstream tasks. If your dataset for these tasks is relatively small, freezing the backbone is a safe way to get strong performance with limited resources.

### 3. **Freezing One of the Task-Specific Heads**
#### Implications:
- **One Task Learns While the Other Does Not**: Freezing one of the task-specific heads means that it will not learn during training, while the other task-specific head and potentially the transformer continue to be updated. This might be useful if one task is more critical or if you’re satisfied with the performance of the frozen task and want to focus training on the other.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Focused Learning**: You can focus the learning on the more challenging or less developed task. For example, if Task A is already well-learned (e.g., sentence classification), freezing its head allows you to concentrate on improving Task B (e.g., sentiment analysis).
- **Avoid Overfitting for One Task**: If you believe one task is at risk of overfitting due to limited data, freezing that task’s head can prevent the model from adapting too much to the noise or idiosyncrasies of the training data for that task.

#### Rationale:
- **Recommended when one task is already performing well**, and you want to continue training for the other task. This can be useful in incremental learning scenarios, where a model was previously trained for Task A and you want to add Task B without degrading Task A’s performance.


### 4. **Transfer Learning Scenario**

#### **Step 1: Choice of Pre-Trained Model**
- **Model Selection**: Choose a model pre-trained on a large, diverse corpus. In this case, using a model like **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, or **MiniLM** is appropriate. These models are trained on vast corpora and can capture general sentence representations that are useful across a wide range of NLP tasks.
- For **sentence-level tasks**, a model from the **sentence-transformers** library, like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or `distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens`, is an excellent choice. These models are specifically tuned for sentence similarity tasks but can be adapted for other classification tasks.

#### **Step 2: Freezing/Unfreezing Layers**
**Approach**: A common strategy in transfer learning is to start by freezing most layers of the model and progressively unfreezing them as training continues.
- **Initially Freeze the Transformer Backbone**: Since the backbone is pre-trained and has learned good general representations, it’s beneficial to freeze it initially to preserve this general knowledge.
- **Unfreeze Final Few Layers of the Transformer (Optional)**: If you have a larger dataset, you can unfreeze the final few layers of the transformer to allow more task-specific fine-tuning. This lets the model adjust the representations closer to the output in ways that may benefit your specific tasks.
- **Train the Task-Specific Heads**: Unfreeze the task-specific heads from the beginning. These heads are small and lightweight compared to the transformer, and they need to learn to map the shared sentence embeddings to the desired outputs for each task.

#### **Rationale Behind Freezing and Unfreezing**
- **Freeze the Transformer to Prevent Overfitting**: Initially freezing the backbone reduces the risk of overfitting, especially if the dataset is small. The transformer has already been trained on a large corpus, so freezing it leverages this general knowledge.
- **Unfreezing Layers Gradually**: Unfreezing the final layers of the transformer allows for some fine-tuning to adapt to the specific tasks. This is particularly useful when you have enough data to support fine-tuning without risking overfitting.
- **Transfer Learning Maximizes Data Efficiency**: Transfer learning allows the model to quickly adapt to your tasks using fewer data, as the pre-trained model already captures much of the syntactic and semantic structure needed for NLP tasks.


### 5. **Summary of Training Strategies**:

- **Freeze Entire Network**: 
  - **Pros**: Fastest training, no risk of overfitting.
  - **Cons**: No adaptation to the specific tasks.
  - **When to Use**: If your tasks are very similar to the pre-training tasks.
  
- **Freeze Transformer Backbone**: 
  - **Pros**: Retains general knowledge from pre-training, reduces overfitting risk, faster training.
  - **Cons**: Task-specific learning limited to heads, may miss task-specific nuances.
  - **When to Use**: For small datasets or when the pre-trained model is a good fit for your tasks.
  
- **Freeze Task-Specific Head**:
  - **Pros**: Focuses learning on one task, avoids overfitting for the frozen task.
